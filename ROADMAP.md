## Version 0.4.1 - ISO Image Support (🔄 Postponed - Multiboot Approach)

**Goal:** Extend build system with bootable ISO generation

### Original Status
Direct ISO generation with our custom bootloader was **not feasible** because:
- El Torito ISO boot requires either GRUB/Multiboot or a custom ISO boot sector
- Our custom bootloader uses BIOS int 13h which expects raw disk access
- xorriso/genisoimage create ISO9660 filesystem which our bootloader can't read

### Alternative Plan: Multiboot2 + GRUB
Instead of rewriting our bootloader, we will add Multiboot2 support:
- [ ] **Multiboot2 Header** - Add Multiboot2 header to kernel entry
- [ ] **Dual Boot Support** - Kernel handles both our bootloader and GRUB
- [ ] **GRUB Configuration** - Create grub.cfg for ISO boot
- [ ] **grub-mkrescue** - Use GRUB tools for ISO generation
- [ ] **`make iso`** - Makefile target for ISO creation

**Benefits:**
- Our custom bootloader remains for raw disk images (`kios.bin`)
- GRUB handles ISO booting (well-tested, reliable)
- Same kernel binary works with both boot methods

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium
**Status:** Postponed to after v0.6.0

## Version 0.5.0 - User Mode & System Calls (✅ Completed - 2026-01-19)

**Goal:** Implement user space separation and system call interface

### Completed Features
- ✅ **User Mode Setup**
  - ✅ GDT entries for user mode (Ring 3) - User Data (0x18), User Code (0x20)
  - ✅ TSS RSP0 for kernel stack on privilege switches
  - ✅ User stack setup with PAGE_USER mapped pages

- ✅ **System Calls**
  - ✅ syscall/sysret interface (modern, fast)
  - ✅ MSR configuration (EFER, STAR, LSTAR, SFMASK)
  - ✅ swapgs mechanism for per-CPU data (GS_BASE/KERNEL_GS_BASE)
  - ✅ Basic syscalls: `sys_write()`, `sys_exit()`, `sys_read()` (placeholder), `sys_yield()` (placeholder)
  - ✅ Syscall dispatcher in C

- ✅ **User Mode Execution**
  - ✅ Position-independent bytecode execution
  - ✅ `usertest` command to test Ring 3 transition
  - ✅ PAGE_USER propagation through all page table levels (PML4, PDPT, PD, PT)
  - ✅ TLB flush after user page mapping

**Actual Complexity:** Extreme
**Actual Time:** 2 days (2026-01-18 to 2026-01-19)

### Key Accomplishments
- Solved swapgs mechanism: GS_BASE=0 (user), KERNEL_GS_BASE=&cpu_data (kernel)
- Fixed IRQ handlers to NOT touch GS register (breaks swapgs)
- Implemented cpu_data structure for per-CPU kernel/user stack pointers
- GDT order matters for SYSRET: User Data before User Code
- IRETQ for Ring 0 → Ring 3 transition, SYSRET for syscall return
